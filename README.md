# Simple Web Calculator

A basic web-based calculator implemented with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.

## Description

This web calculator allows basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) on two operands. The application ensures a straightforward and user-friendly interface for interactions and calculations, avoiding the usage of `eval()` for expressions evaluation due to its potential risks and vulnerabilities.

### Key Features:
- Basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- Interactive UI with buttons for digits 0-9, operations (+, -, *, /), equals (=), and clear (C).
- Handling operations and updates dynamically on the display screen.
- Ability to continue calculations using the result of the last operation.

## How to Use

1. **Input Numbers:**
   - Click on number buttons (0-9) to input numbers.
   
2. **Perform Operations:**
   - Click on an operator button (+, -, *, /) after entering the first operand.
   - Then, input the second operand and click the equals button (=) to get the result.
   
3. **Clear the Display:**
   - To reset or clear the calculations, click the "C" button.
   
4. **Continuous Calculations:**
   - After a result is displayed, you can perform further operations on it by selecting another operator and operand.

## Code Structure

Hereâ€™s a succinct breakdown of the JavaScript code functionality:

- **Number Input:**
  - The `buttons` event listeners manage the input of numbers and update the display accordingly.

- **Operation Input:**
  - The `operators` event listeners enable the selection of an arithmetic operator (+, -, *, /) and prepare the calculator for the second operand.

- **Calculation and Result Display:**
  - The `equal` event listener evaluates the expression when the equals button (=) is clicked, displays the result, and sets up the calculator for further calculations.

- **Reset/Clear Calculator:**
  - The `clear` event listener resets the display and all stored operand/operator values.

## Known Limitations

- Does not handle floating-point precision issues.
- Limited to single-digit operations.
- No handling of successive operator click events.
- No visual feedback for button clicks or error states.
  
## Future Enhancements

- Handling complex expressions and multiple operations.
- Implementing keyboard support for input.
- Improving the UI and providing responsive design for mobile and tablet views.
- Managing and displaying errors to users (e.g., division by zero).
